{
  "employeeName":"Name Lastname",
  "employeeId":"1234567890",
  "leaveReason":"I want to go bird watching",
  "daysRequested":"10"
}

localhost:9000/requests/update
2. Update existing request (Example requestId)
  (a) Use any request Id from (1.) or Create a new request then copy returned id

  {
    "requestId":"b9e65c53-129c-447c-99a5-9c2d44331a73",
    "leaveReason": "Swimming in a river",
    "daysRequested":"15"
  }

localhost:9000/requests/retrieve
3. To retrive all leave requests. just use the chosen employee id when creating a request
  {
    "employeeId":"1234567890"
  }

localhost:9000/requests/Delete (with capital D -- too lazy to fix it as its inconsequential)
4. To delete a request simply pass chose id to endpoint. retrieving all requests will omit deleted request (Example requestId)
  {
    "requestId":"9986a302-ae8d-4058-8c70-a887e5592c0e"
  }
